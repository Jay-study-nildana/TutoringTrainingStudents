1. Classes and Objects. (data structures)
1. JSON
1. Promises and Async
1. Shortcircuiting with || and && 
1. ?? Nullish Coalescing Operator.

Strings

1. ${literals} with ` ${variable} `

Arrays (data structures)

1. []
1. new Array()
1. start with 0
1. [0] or [1]

Objects (data structures)

1. basic object.
1. dot for basic access

1. functions inside objects

Advanced Arrays

1. [x,y,z] = array aka destructuring using []
1. [x,y,[a,b]] = nested destructuring using [] for nested arrays
1. default value using '='
1. spread oprator ... (right side)
1. copying arrays and adding elements front or back
1. very useful for making strings individual letters because stings are arrays
1. combine arrays rest operator. (left side)
1. for-of 
1. entries function with spread operator

Advanced Objects

1. {a,b} = {} destructure object using {}
1. give specific names using :
1. override existing names using ()
1. spread operator ... (right side)
1. copy objects. becaues, you should not manipulate original objects
1. rest operator ... (left side)

1. https://api.nasa.gov/ get API key
1. built basic paragraph, header, image with place holder and button
1. link button to NASA api call
1. use fetch to connect to NASA API endpoint
1. extract data from json object
1. manipulate DOM to show data from NASA

Reference

1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence

Next, resume with functions.

1. functions. defining old school aka function declaration. calling. passing parameters. return value. function chaining.
1. anonymous function aka function expression, using them like variables. usually with const.
1. arrow function. confusing but widely used and shorter
1. all three types of functions. https://codepen.io/jay-pancodu/pen/BaPwbRG

now, the main programming concepts

1. operators. +, -, *, /, % , ** (power), typeof, +=, -=, ++ (and other variations), 
1. operators. =
1. opeartors. >,<,== (automatic string conversion), === (no automatic string conversion).
1. operator precendence. dig deeper as per your job. skipping this.
1. string. "", '', `${variableString}`.
1. if else and else if. note: use boolean values without '==' operator. common practice.
1. switch. 
1. Type Conversion. Number(variable). String(variable). Please don't do this. 
1. truthy and falsy values. Boolean(variable).
1. use prompt to get input in console. https://codepen.io/jay-pancodu/pen/YzjrgWr
1. ternary operator. x ? y : z. replacement for if else. 

Next, Arrays and For Loops. 

1. coming soon.

Weekend Class Topics.

Part One : General Setting

1. Practising JavaScript in the console. 
1. Understand the role of JS in the HTML, CSS and JS combo.
1. Quick Demo. Button Clicking with event handler. 
    1. https://codepen.io/Mestika/pen/XmvVmx (Original)
    1. https://codepen.io/jay-pancodu/pen/gOjgQgr (my remix)
1. Some intro about ES standards. ES6 is the biggest revision. This is what really matters. old and new, don't really matter and are minor improvements.
1. Code Storage : GitHub, CodePen. 
1. Asking doubts. Already discussed, but, revisiting.
1. JavaScript Starter Template. The bootstrap starter already has JS file linked.
    1. https://codepen.io/jay-pancodu/pen/abjbrxK (Ameesha Patel and Bootstrap)
    1. https://codepen.io/jay-pancodu/pen/gOjaGbX (Ameesha Patel and Bootstrap) (Dec 25th version)

    1. https://codepen.io/jay-pancodu/pen/RwBKEJQ (WITHOUT Ameesha Patel or Bootstrap)
    1. folder, JavaScriptStarterTemplate. (WITHOUT Ameesha Patel or Bootstrap)
1. some basic JS, if else, add, subtract and things like that. 
1. Using the console to see output. 

Part Two : Variables and Values inside Variables.

1. https://codepen.io/jay-pancodu/pen/WNKRPeV
1. Variable are like water bottles or water buckets or purse or bag.
1. camelCase is recommended. helloBatman. beautifulAmeeshaPatel. ameeshaPatel.
1. become good at using proper variable names. make it long, and meaningful. DONT BE LAZY.
1. constants use UPPERCASE. 
1. Datatypes : Number which are always float.
1. Datatypes : string
1. Datatypes : boolean
1. Datatypes : Undefined
1. Datatypes : null
1. Datatypes : Symbol //not required
1. Datatypes : BigInt //not required
1. typeof to find out types.
1. JavaScript is all about DYNAMIC TYPING. makes life easy and confusing at the same time. Compare and Contrast with strongly typed languages like C# in .NET.
1. Comments. // and /* */. Ctrl / in VS Code and CodePen.
1. Why use comments? DOCUMENTATION. Politeness. Etiquette. Responsibility. Team Player. 
1. Better to comment than delete. Useful for reference, and reuse later. 
1. let and const and var.
1. const is NON MUTABLE.
