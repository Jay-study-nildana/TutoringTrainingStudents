# Edureka 7 PM Batch

This is the private repo of 7 PM Batch.

If you are interested, you can apply for internship to work with me. Details are available at this [link](https://medium.com/projectwt/inviting-applications-for-paid-internship-for-open-source-project-76ed5761e673).

# Doubt Policy

You can ask any type of doubt you want. Even if it's out of syllabus I don't really mind. 

Rules for asking doubts.

1. Create a new 'GitHub Issue'. put relevant code in the issue.
1. Show the full project code on CodePen or any similar code sandbox, and share the link in the GitHub Issue.
1. If code is too complex for CodePen, then, put your code in a github repository and add me as a colloborator.
1. As much as possible, use the mini projects shared in the class and ask doubts based on these projects. You will get your solutions faster.
1. Don't get hung up on intricate CSS and Bootsrap rules. Also, please avoid asking obscure questions about obscure topics. Focus on the basics. This is a fresher batch after all.

# Diary
